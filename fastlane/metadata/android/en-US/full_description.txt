This App for Android 4.2 Jelly Bean and later (Android 11) reads RSS stream from lemonde.fr.

Thanks to Web scraping, it renders the article and its comments in the feed directly in native Android components.

This App was also built to be as fastest and simple as possible. Material design guidelines were applied so you'll find:

- A menu with your favorites and all categories
- The ability to refresh the feed with "Pull to refresh"
- And to customize the feeds to display
- In the settings, a dark mode or a light mode

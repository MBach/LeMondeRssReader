This App for Android 4.2 Jelly Bean and later (Android 11) reads RSS stream from lemonde.fr.

Thanks to Web scraping, it renders the article and its comments in the feed directly in native Android components.

This App was also built to be as fastest and simple as possible. Material design guidelines were applied so you'll find:

- A menu with your favorites and all categories
- The ability to refresh the feed with "Pull to refresh"
- In the settings, a dark mode or a light mode
- And finally, for the smartphones on Android 7.1 and up: dynamic shortcuts (long press) before opening the App, to quicly access the categories you're reader the most
